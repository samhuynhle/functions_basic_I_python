#1
# def a():
#     return 5
# print(a())

# Defined is function a, which has no defined paramaters for the function. Within function a, the code that is executed returns the value of 5.
# Function a is called within the print method.
# Predicted output: 5
# Predicted output is correct.

#2
def a():
    return 5
print(a()+a())

# Defined is function a, which has no defined paramters for the function. Within function a, the code that is execute returns a value of 5.
# Function a is called twice within the print method. Within the print method, the values of the functions are added together. Since both values are integers,
# The value the is printed will be the addition of both function's value.
# Predicted output: 10
# Predicted output is correct.
